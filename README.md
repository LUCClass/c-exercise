# In-Class C Exercise

In this exercise we are going to build a program that counts the number of
spaces in an input string. You will be graded on the functionality of your
program. You can work in groups of two in class, and commit your program at the
end of class. Neil will grade after class.

Read the C book, section 1.5 for ideas about how to do it.

## Compiling your Code

    $ gcc proggie.c -o proggie

## Example Outputs

    $ echo "This is a string" | ./proggie
    Number of spaces = 3
